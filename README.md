3. **Customer Insights**
4. **Sales Managers**

## Contents
- `Superstore.xls`: The dataset used for the dashboards.
- `superstore dashboards.pbix`: The Power BI file containing the dashboards (if shareable).
- `screenshots/`: A folder containing screenshots or PDF exports of the dashboards.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset (`Superstore.xls`) and open it in your Power BI environment.
2. Open the Power BI file (`Sales_Dashboards.pbix`) or import the dataset into a new Power BI project.
3. Customize the dashboards as needed for your own analysis or use the existing ones for business insights.

## Dashboards Overview
- **Sales Overview:** Provides an overview of total sales, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
- **Profit Overview:** Displays profit margins, overall profit trends, and key profitability drivers.
- **Customer Insights:** Analyzes customer data, including customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- **Sales Managers:** Assists in tracking sales performance by individual managers or teams.

## Requirements

## How to View Dashboards
If you don't have a work ID and cannot publish dashboards, you can still share them via:
1. **Screenshots:** Capture key views of your dashboards and upload them in a `/screenshots` folder.
2. **PDF Export:** Power BI allows you to export dashboards as PDFs. You can share these PDFs in the repository.
3. **GitHub Pages (Optional):** If you're familiar with HTML, you could create a basic webpage to showcase the screenshots and other insights. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to host static sites directly from your GitHub repo.
